## 'SMALL' FIXES
* in color-picker : scroll to adjust brigthness
* when drawing weaves: (REFACTOR)
	steal 2 keys for inverting weavity and rotity, rclick goes through all 4 states
 	wb, wy: real-time effect (does wb exist yet)?

* be able to set default div by shape type ( maybe do when we do the params thing)
* remake tooltips (mostly done)
* re-add polylines


## LATER (features):
* rewind (autosaves)
* finish hooks refactor

* pdf guide pages
* snappy polar grid
* arcs
* refactor terminal + text? autocomplete
* manual

## "DETAILS":
* recovery saves
* rethink ! save logic? (try not to warn uselessly)
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes
* be able to set params
* 'menu_translate'
