## 'SMALL' FIXES
* in color-picker : scroll to adjust brigthness
* remake tooltips
* reput shortcuts in menu
* when drawing weaves: (REFACTOR)
	steal 2 keys for inverting weavity and rotity, rclick goes through all 4 states
 	wb, wy: real-time effect (does wb exist yet)?
* rename 'mirror' to 'flip'?
* rm weaves when changing div (until better idea) ?
* be able to set default div by shape type
* still problem (menu cut) when changing the res param (in param.py)?

## CURRENT:
	* finish hook refactor?
	* interactive transforms
		* subhook deco?
		recenter (+ interactive center?), 
		flip (mouse control axis rel to center)
		rot (2 clicks)
		put copy
		effect
		cancel

## LATER (features):
* rewind (autosaves)

* pdf guide pages
* snappy polar grid
* arcs
* refactor terminal + text? autocomplete
* manual

## "DETAILS":
* recovery saves
* rethink ! save logic? (try not to warn uselessly)
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes
* be able to set params
