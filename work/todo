## Min for v2
* manual + better tooltips
	* tweak help/post-info command, multi-line docs for commands
	* Grid hints.
* proper install? (with pip)
* something about bug n2, bug n3 fixed?

Keep or no: prefer selected for disambiguting (in weaves)?
For hints, translate QWERASDF

## Bugs
1: (can't reproduce) saw interactive_transform/merge/weave bug
2: weird event bugs in miniter (rctl or ctl-bksp)
3: crash due to 0 points grid?

# details:
* remake tooltips (mostly done (VISUAL)). Keep up to date
* be able to set params + show/hide some types of thing
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes?
* refactor: should have a math_utils module (put some of the shape helper funs, + some utils)
