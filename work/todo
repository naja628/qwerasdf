### OLD

## Easy Details
* look for rc first in cwd, then in user home

## LATER (features):

* pinning commands under V 

* manual 
* 'menu_translate' (easy but PITA)

Extra
* snappy polar grid, 
	(snappy_get_points should accepts extras, also use divs of intermediate from `interactive_transform` in extras)
* refactor terminal + text? autocomplete, history, types?
* export images

## "DETAILS":
	# Really Do
* be able to set params + show/hide some types of thing
* remake tooltips (mostly done (VISUAL)). Keep up to date
	# Eh
* fix ! logic in command
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes?

* command line args: commands, session, open, norc
