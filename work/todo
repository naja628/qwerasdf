## Now
Finish Grid:
* grid hook can: on/off | +/- sparse | set phase (get phase to work) | recenter
* commands to set subdivs

* colors use monospace

## Bugs
* (can't reproduce) saw weird rewind behavior
* (can't reproduce) saw interactive_transform/merge/weave bug
* weird event bugs in miniter (rctl or ctl-bksp)

## Min for v2
* manual
* rework command descriptions + hints?
* proper install process

# Extra
* command line args: 
	basic: open first arg --norc --noconf --session= --cl --wd=

* rectangle or polygon selection
* view show/hide options

# Extra+
* menu_translate
* pinned commands

# Extra++
* export images
* sync with save file
* refactor terminal, (autocomplete, history, types, etc)

# details:
* remake tooltips (mostly done (VISUAL)). Keep up to date
* be able to set params + show/hide some types of thing
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes?
* refactor: should a math_utils module (put some of the shape helper funs, + some utils)
