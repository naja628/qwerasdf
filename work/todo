"small" fixes:
* in color-picker : scroll to adjust brigthness
* remake tooltips
* when drawing weaves: 
 	let scroll stay zoom, but midclick changes rotity
 	wb, wy: real-time effect (does wb exist yet)?
* reput shortcuts in menu
* recovery saves
* rm weaves when changing div (until better idea) ?
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* still problem when changing the res param (in param.py)?

NEXT:
	* old transfo hooks, 
	* merges
	* automerge all before saving, on command, after transfo

* rewind (autosaves)
* fine transforms
* snappy polar grid
* pdf guide pages
* arcs

next:
restructure the menu (same as old? + separate/ontop move-view)


maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes
