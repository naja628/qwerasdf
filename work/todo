# Now
* set at least some params / have a conf

# Min for v2
* set default div by shape type
* look for rc first in cwd, then in user home

* rework interactive transforms

* manual
* proper install process, put on PiPy ?

+ Ideally
* polar grid

* fix ! logic in commands
* menu_translate
* smth with saves/load (eg lo shows options, `find` command, and accept unifished save names for load?)
* command line args: commands, session, open, norc, continue (load last auto save)
* pinned commands
* view show/hide options

(Extra extra)
* refactor terminal,
* export images
* sync with save file

## Easy Details
* look for rc first in cwd, then in user home
* ls_save ( or in load)

## LATER (features):

* pinning commands under V 
-- checkpoint sunday --

* manual 
* 'menu_translate' (easy but PITA)

Extra
* snappy polar grid, 
	(snappy_get_points should accepts extras, also use divs of intermediate from `interactive_transform` in extras)
* refactor terminal + text? autocomplete, history, types?
* export images

## "DETAILS":
	# Really Do
* be able to set params + show/hide some types of thing
* remake tooltips (mostly done (VISUAL)). Keep up to date
	# Eh
* fix ! logic in command
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes?

* command line args: commands, session, open, norc
