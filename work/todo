# menu translate
when displaying menu
when displaying palette (do monospace at same time)
In the color picker/selector
when reading keys in miniter (set-color, translate-color)
allow configuring translate via conf (read raw?)
## Min for v2
* colors use monospace
* maybe have Point be bigger than div (setable) with params
* menu translate
* manual + better tooltips
* something about bug n2
* proper install? (with pip, AT LEAST: requirement.txt)

## Bugs
1: (can't reproduce) saw interactive_transform/merge/weave bug
2: weird event bugs in miniter (rctl or ctl-bksp)
3: crash due to 0 points grid?

## Min for v2
* manual
* rework command descriptions + hints?
* proper install process

# Extra
* command line args: 
	basic: open first arg --norc --noconf --session= --cl --wd=

* rectangle or polygon selection
* view show/hide options
* adjust fontsize to winsize

# Extra+
* menu_translate
* pinned commands

# Extra++
* export images
* sync with save file
* refactor terminal, (autocomplete, history, types, etc)

# Extra+++
* select weaves individually
* (drawing weaves) in subview, split ambiguous shapes

# details:
* remake tooltips (mostly done (VISUAL)). Keep up to date
* be able to set params + show/hide some types of thing
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes?
* refactor: should have a math_utils module (put some of the shape helper funs, + some utils)
