## 'SMALL' FIXES
* be able to set default div by shape type ( maybe do when we do the params thing)
* remake tooltips (mostly done)
* re-add polylines

## NOTES
* for rewind either 'reset_hook' in menu (+ use 'reset_hook' for loading too?)
			 or don't pin it (would allow a pinned commands under V)
* at the same time: do ! logic thing, + import + recover since these have to do with saves too
* when recover needed, cleanup session things


## LATER (features):
* rewind (autosaves)
* finish hooks refactor ( at least select_hook )

* pdf guide pages
* snappy polar grid
* arcs, re-add poly
* refactor terminal + text? autocomplete, history, types?
* export images
* manual

## "DETAILS":
* recovery saves
* rethink ! save logic? (try not to warn uselessly)
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes
* be able to set params
* 'menu_translate'
