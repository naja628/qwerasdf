"small" fixes:
* in color-picker : scroll to adjust brigthness
* remake tooltips
* reput shortcuts in menu
* when drawing weaves: 
 	let scroll stay zoom, but midclick changes rotity
 	wb, wy: real-time effect (does wb exist yet)?
* recovery saves
* still problem when changing the res param (in param.py)?

* rm weaves when changing div (until better idea) ?
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?

NEXT:
	* merges:
		* each subshape has getmerger(other)
			-> None if no overlap
			-> f: i -> j with j on dest (ie self)
	* automerge all before saving, on command, after transfo
	* interactive transforms
		symetry + vis, rotate + vis, recenter, put down, put copy, cancel, undo?

* rewind (autosaves)
* fine transforms
* snappy polar grid
* pdf guide pages
* arcs

next:
restructure the menu (same as old? + separate/ontop move-view)


maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes
