"details":
	circle around problems??
	Menu ctor (change where menu is hardcoded)
	disambiguate clicks/shapes (maybe only in weave)
	maybe add centers for circles
	maybe refactor hooks

do now:
	#
	refactor shapes
	Circles need a start angle
	set_div (with termcommand)
	weave_incr (at least with termcommand)
	# 
	save

want :
	interactive color picker
	help text
	error message timeout
	move the view / click and drag
	more shapes : broken lines, curves
	modify/redraw shapes: rot (dfl or freehand), symetry, scaling?
		make it work with several at once?
	zen view, fullscreen
	resizable window
	menu translate (layout)
	pdf guide pages (with marks for nails)
	improved term-parsing
	more termcommands : dump, help etc
	autosaves
