"details":
	circle around problems??
	Menu ctor (change where menu is hardcoded)
	disambiguate clicks/shapes (maybe only in weave)
	maybe refactor hooks
	error message timeout

do now:
	#
	save
	modify/redraw shapes: rot (dfl or freehand), symetry, scaling?
	#
	menu translate (layout)
	interactive color picker
	help text
	broken lines
	add start dimensions to params

want :
	autosaves
	recover
	move the view / click and drag
	more shapes : broken lines, curves
	zen view
	pdf guide pages (with marks for nails)
	.rc?
	visual linear transforms?, register transforms to shapes etc
	#
	improved term-parsing
	terminal options: (exec commands, non-iteractive, open etc)
	more termcommands : dump, help etc
						create shape
						any transform
