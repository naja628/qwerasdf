impl:
	create pygame user event FORWARD_ACCEPTED
		use it for interactive color-picker
		+ transforms
	Menu:
		shortcuts
		go back to selection after move/transform (use 2 hooks?)
		handle request_forward, (2 match blocks 1 for pinned and one for rest (2nd skipped when request matches))
	create transform hooks
	Shape: 
		add {shape specific data} section to repr (needed for circle clockwise-ness)
		(names: `serialize_specific`, `restore_specific`)
		add _allow_transform methods, and use it in transform
		test transform code
	#
	use V for pinning any argless terminal command (set with params)
	command to open a new file
	fu TOGGLES fullscreen
	#
	wanted: 
		redraw (add `assign` method to shape)
		freehand rotation
		-c option to read script, sh + T terminal commands
	
"details":
	circle mirroring spin problems
	circle around problems??
	disambiguate clicks/shapes (maybe only in weave)
	interactive set div
	move the view / click and drag
	maybe refactor hooks
	still can't draw point (lol)
	hint snappy points

do now:
	interactive color picker
	broken lines
	help text (just put it in the menu)

want :
	zen view
	pdf guide pages (with marks for nails)
	autosaves (+ weird nested system? for rewind)
	more shapes: interpolated curves, arcs, ellipses?
	visual linear transforms?, register transforms to shapes etc
	maybe more view options? ruler, grid etc
	#
	more termcommands : dump, point
	commandline options?
