## PERFORMANCE:
	use squares instead of circles for nails/points
	maybe give points their own layer too
	only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame (maybe do anyway just out of principle)
	when moving / zooming etc, draw 1 string out of n (see if needed via stress test), same for points?
	
## FEATURES:
arcs (figure out best way to draw them... (3 points, 2 + center or fuite, ...)
(simplest circle + other, lclick to orient)

* some sort of grid : polar coordinates, snappy
* REWIND + autosaves 

* pdf guide pages (with marks for nails)
* export images

better system for redivs?
* try to make changing the number of nails work well with existing weaves
* allow rediv to be a ratio?
* compute div numbers that work well with one another
* several redivs at once?
* set default div for shapes?

Non-shit install process (at least requirement.txt + Makefile) + Manual !!!!
Videa tutorial? (lol)

## STILL RELEVANT?:
* alt weave
* visual rotate, visual transform

## EXTRA:
	scaling transforms?
	redesign commandline 
		(autocomplete commands, + maybe more, arg "types"?, multiline out)
		macros?
		select, transform, create, delete?
		pinning terminal commands, rethink menu?
		set params via commandline
		history

	track save file in realtime?
	partial loads / imports
	commandline options? 

	drag rectangle selection
####
+ "details:
	scaling?
	interactive set_div
	finer weave selection
	terminal history
	file autocomplete?

	"set" the symetry globally (ie everything gets drawn n times)
	more shapes: interpolated curves, ellipses?
	more grids: cartesian, triangular?
	visual linear transforms?, register transforms to shapes etc

	more termcommands : dump, point

	make menu remappable?
	measuring tools?
