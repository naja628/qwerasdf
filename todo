"details":
	circle around problems??


	disambiguate clicks/shapes (maybe only in weave)
	interactive set div
	freehand rotation
	move the view / click and drag
	maybe refactor hooks
	still can't draw point (lol)
	hint snappy points (drawing shapes and lines)
	swap circle ends

do now:
	interactive color-picker
	broken-lines

want :
	zen view
	pdf guide pages (with marks for nails)
	use V for pinning terminal commands
	autosaves (+ weird nested system? for rewind)
	more shapes: interpolated curves, arcs, ellipses?
	visual linear transforms?, register transforms to shapes etc
	maybe more view options? ruler, grid etc
	#
	more termcommands : dump, point
	commandline options?
