## Old bugs
* (can't reproduce) saw interactive_transform/merge/weave bug
* weird event bugs in miniter (rctl or ctl-bksp) (MATE specific?)
* crash due to 0 points grid? (fixed I think)

## Bugs
* when not moving after import
	* either random offset or force move then merge

* saves can't start with num (maybe in cmd int is only digits only)
* bug computing divs for polys: wrong size
* ensure weave ordering (new on top even when copying, merging etc)
* arcs div too far (slightly)?

# Extra
* rename menu buttons (more consistent / make more sense)
* wasn't there another needlessly inconsistent thing I wanted to fix?

* stash/unstash ("clipboard" for selection)
* `sym r`/`sym s`
* rectangle selection

----- counts as "finished" (v0.2)

* option where to put out.ps
* auto ps2pdf?

# Extra+

* macros
* cartesian grid, triangle grid
* bezier curves, ellipses (+ arcs)?
* polygon selection?

* allow setting line width, antialias
* command line args: 
	basic: open first arg --norc --noconf --session= --cl --wd=
* pinned commands

# Extra++

* several canvas, move shapes between them.
* connect shapes
* set params from the terminal, all params are dynamic

* view show/hide options (for nails, shapes etc)
* export images

* sync with save file ( I don't think this really works )
* refactor terminal, (autocomplete, history, types, etc)

# Extra+++
* select weaves individually 
* (drawing weaves) in subview, split ambiguous shapes
* arbitrary linear transforms
* gradient weaves (rainbow or lerp, maybe multipoint)
* multiweaves
* some scripting?

# details:
* grid sparseness adjustment should be exponential
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes? (problem: when?)
* refactor: should have a math_utils module (put some of the shape helper funs, + some utils)
