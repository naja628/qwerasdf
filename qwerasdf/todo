## 
Poly overlapping points + in Area select
## Old bugs
* (can't reproduce) saw interactive_transform/merge/weave bug
* weird event bugs in miniter (rctl or ctl-bksp) (MATE specific?)
* crash due to 0 points grid? (fixed I think)
* bug computing divs for polys: wrong size (fixed by rewrite?)

## Bugs
(3) arcs div too far (slightly)? ("solved" by restricting max zoom)

#DONE
* modify quick transforms 
* refactor with math util (mostly)
* arc other order (ortho proj)

# Current batch
(stash)
* in Select submenu: stash?
* stash/unstash ("clipboard" for selection)
	* use with imports (bug 1)

(details)
* rename menu buttons (more consistent / make more sense)
* allow setting line width, antialias

(z ordering)
* ensure weave ordering (new on top even when copying, merging etc)
* raise colors

(export images)
* view show/hide options (for nails, shapes etc)
* export images (svg?)

* option where to put out.ps/ images
* auto ps2pdf?

----- counts as "finished" (v0.2)

* erase hint messages when hooks close

* set params from the terminal, all params are dynamic

# Extra+

* pinned commands
* macros
* cartesian grid, triangle grid
* bezier curves, ellipses (+ arcs)?
* polygon selection?

* command line args: 
	basic: open first arg --norc --noconf --session= --cl --wd=
* remappable menu?
* menu actions via commands?

# Extra++

* several canvas, move shapes between them.
* connect shapes

* sync with save file ( I don't think this really works )
* refactor terminal, (autocomplete, history, types, etc)

# Extra+++
* select weaves individually 
* (drawing weaves) in subview, split ambiguous shapes
* arbitrary linear transforms
* gradient weaves (rainbow or lerp, maybe multipoint)
* multiweaves
* some scripting?
* weave string can bend around nails?

# details:
* refactor transforms + sym command : in context copy shapes utils
* grid sparseness adjustment should be exponential
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes? (problem: when?)
