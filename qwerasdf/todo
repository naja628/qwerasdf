## Bugs

* (can't reproduce) saw interactive_transform/merge/weave bug
* weird event bugs in miniter (rctl or ctl-bksp) (MATE specific?)
* crash due to 0 points grid? (fixed I think)

# Extra
* rename menu buttons (more consistent / make more sense)
* wasn't there another needlessly inconsistent thing I wanted to fix?

* option where to put out.ps
* auto ps2pdf?

# Extra+

* macros
* rectangle or polygon selection
* bezier curves, ellipses?

* allow setting line width, alias
* command line args: 
	basic: open first arg --norc --noconf --session= --cl --wd=
* pinned commands

# Extra++

* connect shapes ( is saving 2 clicks worth it?)
* cartesian grid

* view show/hide options (for nails, shapes etc)
* export images

* sync with save file ( I don't think this really works )
* refactor terminal, (autocomplete, history, types, etc)

# Extra+++
* select weaves individually 
* (drawing weaves) in subview, split ambiguous shapes
* adjust fontsize to winsize

# details:
* grid sparseness adjustment should be exponential
* be able to set params + show/hide some types of thing (kinda done)
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes? (problem: when?)
* refactor: should have a math_utils module (put some of the shape helper funs, + some utils)
