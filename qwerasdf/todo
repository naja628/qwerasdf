## Old bugs
* (can't reproduce) saw interactive_transform/merge/weave bug
* weird event bugs in miniter (rctl or ctl-bksp) (MATE specific?)
* crash due to 0 points grid? (fixed I think)
* bug computing divs for polys: wrong size (fixed by rewrite?)

## Bugs
(1) when not moving after import
	* either random offset or force move then merge

(2) saves can't start with num (maybe in cmd int are digits only)
(3) arcs div too far (slightly)? ("solved" by restricting max zoom)

#DONE
* modify quick transforms 
* refactor with math util (dup details) (mostly)

# Current batch

* arc other order (ortho proj)
* `sym r`/`sym s`

* refactor interactive transforms with math_utils

* place quick transforms in menu
* in Select submenu: toggle all, rectangle-selection, stash?

* rename menu buttons (more consistent / make more sense)

* stash/unstash ("clipboard" for selection)
	* use with imports (bug 1)

* rectangle selection
* to move view: lclick (there was no longer a good reason to use rclick)

* allow setting line width, antialias

* erase hint messages when hooks close

* ensure weave ordering (new on top even when copying, merging etc)
* raise colors

* view show/hide options (for nails, shapes etc)
* export images (svg?)

----- counts as "finished" (v0.2)

* option where to put out.ps
* auto ps2pdf?

* set params from the terminal, all params are dynamic

# Extra+

* macros
* cartesian grid, triangle grid
* bezier curves, ellipses (+ arcs)?
* polygon selection?

* command line args: 
	basic: open first arg --norc --noconf --session= --cl --wd=
* pinned commands
* remappable menu?
* menu actions via commands?

# Extra++

* several canvas, move shapes between them.
* connect shapes

* sync with save file ( I don't think this really works )
* refactor terminal, (autocomplete, history, types, etc)

# Extra+++
* select weaves individually 
* (drawing weaves) in subview, split ambiguous shapes
* arbitrary linear transforms
* gradient weaves (rainbow or lerp, maybe multipoint)
* multiweaves
* some scripting?
* weave string can bend around nails?

# details:
* grid sparseness adjustment should be exponential
* only consider the last MOUSEMOTION every frame ?
* maybe don't draw circle-center on existing shapes, merge points into shapes? (problem: when?)
