## Install & Run

### Short Version (for people used to python)
Install with `pip install .`  
Run as `qwerasdf` or run the `run_qwerasdf.py` script which can be safely moved.  

### 1. Make sure `Python3` and `pip` are installed on your system
On windows just downloaded [the official latest release of python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
and launch the install wizard as you normally would.  
Make sure to **check the box** that says `Add Python3.xx to PATH` in the first screen of the wizard.

On systems with a package manager (assuming `apt` for the example), something like this should do the trick:  
`sudo apt install python3 pip`

### 2. Install with pip
Run the `pip install .` command from the root of the repo.  
Note: you can then uninstall with `pip uninstall qwerasdf`.  

### 3. Run
After installation, you can run the progarm either from the commandline as `qwerasdf`,
or launching the `run_qwerasdf.py` script with python. (You can move it wherever you like)  
Note: Windows should let you double-click `.py` files to run them with python.
